First phase:
set up the application to interact with the Database and READ data from the DB

// Step 1
    - Set up the database connection in the application.properties
    - Create the Employee entity
    - Create DOA interface
    - Create DAO implementation
    - Create the REST controller to use the DOA


Second phase:
Set up the application to use Spring-data-rest
    - Remove controller and service folder
    - SDR creates all the endpoints once you implement JPA resp and creat the entity for the DB
    - endpoints are lowercase path of the entity class but plural. add S at the end.
